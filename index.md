# William Barcenas’s Portfolio 

This is my home page! My name is William Barcenas and I am a student at Cal State Fullerton majoring in Electrical Engineering.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4 
Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites because it was a game. I could explain how it worked to a friend we also played it with. It was just fun being able to play with something I made especially since it worked.
